# extending_digitaldiscovery_data

This repository contains supplimentary data for the publication "Extending Quantum Computing through Subspace, Embedding and Classical Molecular Dynamics Techniques".

The data is structured as follows:
- `input/` - contains the input data and scripts required to run the QM/MM simulation presented in Section 5.
- `quantum/` - contains the Hamiltonian data from the QM/MM simulation and the the scripts for pre- and post-processing circuit executions.
- `plot/` - contains the data and scripts needed to plot Figure 9.
- `LICENSE` - this repository is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2), because it incorporates code adapted from [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps). In particular, the file `input/run.py` is adapted from the LAMMPS source code. The full GPLv2 license for LAMMPS is included here.
